Produce a sales report

Algorithm

//keep tax code multiplier as 0,1,2 a 0, 0.03, and 0.05  

get phone number
get name
get sales amount
get tax code
multiply the appropriate tax code by the sales amount to find the sales tax
add the sales tax to the sales amount to get the total amount due

ask if the customer wants to enter another transaction
if they do then gather information again and process it

once they are done print out “Sales Report” followed by the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax, and the total amount due.



Pseudo Code:

create array that holds the tax code multipliers 
create an array to hold out outputs
do
	ask user for phone number
	ask user for name
	ask user for sales amount
	ask user for tax code
	sales tax = (tax code multiplier)+1 * sales amount
	amount due = sales tax + sales amount

	combine the appropriate data into a single string and add this to our printable array.

	ask if user has any more items to add
	
	compare the response to “y” and “n” (ignoring case) 
		if
		 	y- start again with the reprompt
		else if	n- exit program
		else	any other- error message and reprompt
while (response is not n)

Print 
	“Sales Report”
	[number] [name] [sales amount] [sales tax] [amount due]	//this is from out printable array
	…
	…
	… continue until all items have been printed
Exit program
